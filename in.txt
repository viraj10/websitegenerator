How can we be better

1. Some body hits a url that belongs to our client.
2. Our client has a base page without much content in it. With in base page their is Some SEO info in meta data. This page makes a call to our server for complete page html and also content. With call it passes us the client id(that we have assigned to client) and page type(login, welcome, about, etc).
3. This is a cross domain call. Also here we check is this call really from our client. The request is aborted if its not our client.
4. Client id is unique , so from this we check what is the template selected by this client.
5. We try to get web page in side the template. Each template has 4-6 web pages. Web page is decided from page type received from client and template is decided at 4.
6. We make html ready and rest of resources ready and sent it to the client
7. JS adds html to our client web page. this makes web page ready but it still without much of content e.g images.
8. We make a call for images and other textual data contents. We pass the token representing the contetnt we want. 
9. We again validate this is from authorized client.

11.We try to get the contents that client web page asked for.
12.We retrieve the content.
13.Our server passes the contents in response to the call made by client web page.
